Clone-WebOS
===========


## discription:

###introduction

   today we live in a world dominated by cloud computeing were most of the things we do are done on
   someone else's servers, the desktop as we know it nolonger exists. the only issue with runing a OS
   over the web is you do not know where your data is or who has it but even though this is true it is
   still nice to run a OS over the web and not have to spend money on a powerful computer and run every 
   thing though a think client. Clone-WebOS is a trade off of a Cloud based OS and a Localy hosted OS
   in that every things is run though one server but it is run localy on your network and if you were
   to get another computer it dose not need to powerful, it can be a thin client that connects to the
   server that runs Clone-WebOS. another limiting thing about Cloud OS's is that you can not realy do
   what you want with them such as wright code modif the OS its selfand being that your WebOS is run localy 
   on Clone-WebOS you can do any thing that you what with your server and the software is open sorce. 
   
###how dose the OS work

  There are two parts of clone web os is Client OS (can just be something that has web-kit) and the Server OS.
  The Server OS is what runs on the Server and is the thing that holds all of the your data. the Server OS
  uses Debain Linux and a LAMP server to run a web server (Clone Web OS is run over web-kit) and a database for 
  all the user data and such. the Server OS also has the Clone Web OS enviromet witch a web server witch is a
  combonation of
  
  * php
  * javascript
  * jqeary
  * html
  * css
 
  you interact with the OS just like you would a web site.
